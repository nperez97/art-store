## Nefi Perez | IS 542 | Semester Project 

For my project, I worked on a shop where my wife can feature and sell her artwork. The website uses React, Stripe, and Commercejs. In this project, there is functionality to add items to a cart, remove items, clear cart, and checkout items. 

Using external resources like stripe and commercejs, it helped do lots of the heavy lifting with payments themselves and also shipping details. These tools also send confirmation emails after a purchase is made. 

### Technologies Used
* Material UI (styling)
* CSS
* React
* Stripe
* Commercejs

### What I do More Time 
* Categorical Filtering of Products
* Image Grows upon Click
* Skeleton loading frames
* Using context instead of prop drilling
